# Hopping Robot Gym
This implements an OpenAI gym environment for [Dan Lynch's](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/students/lynch-dan.html) hopping robot. The research is motivated and further described in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9018262). Below is an image of the robot as it is starting an episode in Bullet. <br />
